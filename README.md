# Udacity Full Stack Web Developer
# Project 1 - Movie Trailer website.

by Gene Ting-Chun Kao

The source code is forked from the [starter code repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode).

**Result HTML page** can be found [here](https://genekao.github.io/ud036_StarterCode/) in my github.io.
(The preview movie trailer is not working on the github website, please download or clone it to try it.)

## To Run the code

- Download and run the code
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/GeneKao/ud036_StarterCode.git
$ cd ud036_StarterCode
$ python entertainment_center.py
```
- After running the code through python, the browser should be opened automatically. If not then open the fresh_tomatoes.html in the folder.

## Highlight
In the file [media.py](https://github.com/GeneKao/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/media.py), two classes Movie() and TvShow() are inheritance class of Video(). And original [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/GeneKao/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) is modified using **if condition** to determine between TV shows and movie, so different attributes can be shown on the website.
